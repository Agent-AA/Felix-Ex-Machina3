# Felis Ex Machina Robot Code

This repository hosts the robot code for Team 1308's 2024 Crescendo robot. It was developed from REVRobotics's [MAXSwerve-Java-Template](https://github.com/REVrobotics/MAXSwerve-Java-Template).

### I am one of the builders or electricians. How do I request a bug fix or feature addition?

1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/Agent-AA/Felix-Ex-Machina3/issues/new). Be as descriptive as possible about what you want changed.
2. The programming team will review the issue and create a new [branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) to fix the issue.
3. The branch will be tested for quality assurance.
4. If the branch passes QA testing, it will be merged into the robot's production code and made an official part of it.
